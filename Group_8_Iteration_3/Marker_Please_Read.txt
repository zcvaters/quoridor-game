Hi, thanks for reading.

We hope you like the latest release.  

Please try starting a new game, set up some colors and players, and begin.

The JAR for this iteration does not have take-a-turn active yet, but you should be able to see
your players at their randomized starting positions.  The mouseover for wall placement is operational,
and you can click to place some walls.

You could try saving at this point, and then quitting/re-loading.  It should work fine.

A couple of other notes on the documentation:

- We've been (sort of) reprimanded over the past few reviews for not having recognized AI as a separate entity. :)
We just wanted to point out that our design uses a single Player class for both human and AI players.  
The type of player is distinguished via an attribute within the Player class.
When the game controller calls for the next Player, a check is made on the player's type.  If human, control is passed
to the user. If AI, control will be passed to the AI manager.  The Player is moved, like a pawn, by the appropriate controller.

- The Seq Diagram for Load Game is really detailed, it's best to download and view (or right-click and View Image) rather than using github.

We look forward to your comments and suggestions.

Thanks!
Group8.
